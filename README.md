### System Design Flow

1.  **Source Database (PostgreSQL)**:
    
    *   Store the schema and initial data in a PostgreSQL database.
        
2.  **Message Broker (Kafka)**:
    
    *   Capture changes from PostgreSQL and publish them to Kafka topics.
        
3.  **Data Warehouse (ClickHouse)**:
    
    *   Consume messages from Kafka and load them into ClickHouse for OLAP queries.
        
4.  **Dashboard**:
    
    *   Use a BI tool (e.g., Grafana) to visualize the data in ClickHouse in real-time.
        

### Implementation Steps

1.  **Set Up PostgreSQL with Docker**:Create a Docker container for PostgreSQL and load the provided schema.
    
2.  **Set Up Kafka with Docker**:Create a Docker container for Kafka to handle data streaming.
    
3.  **Set Up ClickHouse with Docker**:Create a Docker container for ClickHouse to act as the OLAP database.
    
4.  **Data Pipeline**:
    
    *   Use Kafka Connect to capture changes from PostgreSQL.
        
    *   Set up Kafka Connect ClickHouse sink to load data into ClickHouse.
        
5.  **Dashboard**:
    
    *   Set up Grafana to visualize the data from ClickHouse.
  
### Kafka Connect Configuration

Create a Kafka Connect configuration to capture changes from PostgreSQL and stream them to ClickHouse. This involves configuring Kafka Connect with the PostgreSQL source connector and ClickHouse sink connector.

### BI Dashboard

Configure Grafana to connect to ClickHouse and create dashboards for real-time reporting based on the data stored in ClickHouse.

### Summary

This setup will enable real-time data streaming from PostgreSQL to ClickHouse using Kafka, and visualizing the data in Grafana. This approach ensures low latency and real-time insights for Rembo Companyâ€™s business needs. The next steps involve implementing each component and ensuring they are correctly integrated to achieve the desired real-time reporting functionality.
